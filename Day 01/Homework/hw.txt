Here are **10 simple tasks** to help you practice the `Promise` constructor and working with promises in JavaScript:

---

### 1. **Create a basic Promise that resolves immediately**
   - Task: Use the `Promise` constructor to create a promise that resolves with the message `"Hello, Promise!"`.

---

### 2. **Create a Promise that rejects with an error**
   - Task: Write a promise that rejects with the message `"Something went wrong!"` and handle the rejection with `.catch()`.

---

### 3. **Use `setTimeout` to resolve a Promise after 2 seconds**
   - Task: Create a promise that waits for 2 seconds using `setTimeout` and then resolves with `"2 seconds have passed"`.

---

### 4. **Handle both resolve and reject outcomes**
   - Task: Write a promise that randomly either resolves with `"Success!"` or rejects with `"Failed!"` using `Math.random()`. Handle both outcomes with `.then()` and `.catch()`.

---

### 5. **Create a chain of promises using `.then()`**
   - Task: Create a promise that resolves with the number `5`. Chain multiple `.then()` calls to multiply the number by `2` in each step.

---

### 6. **Simulate a network request using Promises**
   - Task: Create a promise that resolves with `"Data fetched!"` after 1 second. Use `setTimeout` to simulate the delay.
